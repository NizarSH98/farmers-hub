### Step 2: Prepare Files
Save/rename your logos as:
```
fhf-logo-icon.png       → Square, 400×400px minimum, PNG transparent
fhf-logo-horizontal.png → Wide, 800×200px minimum, PNG transparent
fhf-logo-white.png      → Square, 400×400px, for dark mode (optional)
```

### Step 3: Add to Platform
```bash
# Copy your logo files to:
assets/images/logos/

# That's it! No code changes needed.
```

### Step 4: Verify
1. Refresh your browser
2. Check header - logo should appear (not 🌾 emoji)
3. Check authentication modal - logo above title
4. Check footer - horizontal logo with FHF branding
5. Test dark mode toggle
